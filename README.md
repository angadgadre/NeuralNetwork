NeuralNetworks
=============

Objective: Understand how Neural Network works and use Feed Forward, Back Propagation to implement Neural Network.

1.Project implemented on Matlab. Requires to solve optimization problem similar to stochastic gradient descent.
2.Analyse overfitting and underfitting by finding optimum hyperparameter lamda.
3.Develop benchmarks.
